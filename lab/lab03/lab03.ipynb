    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp) can be used for pattern matching in a text editor.  For example, when you use the \"find and replace\" feature in Microsoft Word, you are asking the computer to find specific strings which match a pattern and replace them with another string. We might desire a more flexible way to search and replace. For example, we might wish to locate and replace a word spelled two different ways in a text: serialise and serialize (British and American spelling). The regular expression `seriali[sz]e` matches both \"serialise\" and \"serialize\". Wildcard characters also achieve this, but are more limited in what they can pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other examples where this flexibilty is useful might be searching for and extracting email addresses from a file.  We know there will be an at sign (@), but don't know what the constraints are in front of it in terms of word length or characters used. It is possible to read through texts and look for patterns using string methods like `split()` and `find()`. However, searching and extracting is so common that there is a powerful library for these tasks (`re`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `re` module provides a set of powerful regular expression facilities, which allows you to quickly check whether a given string matches a given pattern (using the match function), or contains such a pattern (using the search function). A regular expression is a string pattern written in a compact (and quite cryptic) syntax.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The module functions fall into three categories:\n",
    "- pattern matching\n",
    "- substitution\n",
    "- splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "The regex describes a pattern to locate in the text, and then we can use specific methods to accomplish tasks.  You can then ask questions such as “Does this string match the pattern?”, or “Is there a match for the pattern anywhere in this string?” You can also use regular expression to modify a string or to split it apart in various ways.\n",
    "\n",

Human beings have 23 pairs of chromosomes in our cells and each of our parents contributes one chromosome to each pair. The gene that causes Huntington's Disease (HD) is found on chromosome 4.  Each of us gets one copy of the gene from our mother and one copy from our father.\n",

We all have these CAG repeats in the gene that codes for the huntingtin protein, but people with HD have a greater number than usual of CAG repeats in one of the genes they inherited.  (This protein is found in many of the body's tissues, with the highest levels of activity in the brain. Within cells, this protein may be involved in chemical signaling, transporting materials, binding to proteins and other structures, etc.)\n",
